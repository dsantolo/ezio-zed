# ezio-zed

The Ezio theme for Zed.

Ezio is a minimalistic, low-color-range theme for Zed. There is currently only a light theme, but I have plans to add a dark version in the future.

- It attempts to remove as many of the default UI elements as possible, while still remaining functional and easy to use.

- Instead of using a large number of colors to differentiate between syntax tokens, Ezio uses a small number of colors to achieve a clean and readable look. The theme only uses color to differentiate between comments, strings, and all other tokens. Beyond that, it differentiates between other syntax tokens via font weight. I really have to credit Zed for allowing this type of configuration, as otherwise the theme wouldn't work nearly as well, and likely be too extreme for most people.

- Ezio is supposed to be a "light" theme (where text is darker than its background), while still using a relatively dark background color to be easy to look at for long periods of time.

- The color scheme is inspired by the one used in Assassin's Creed 2's menus, but no attempts were made to lift the exact colors from that game.
